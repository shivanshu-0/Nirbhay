## Nirbhay, A surveillance and security android app.

**1.  What our app does.**
  - Predicts the safety of a particular route at a particular instant of time ,according to the reviews of previous commuters that have travelled through that road, and other features like CCTV cameras on road, Number of housing societies,availability of flood lights,and the official police record.
  - Panic Button for the user,which when pressed by user if they are feeling unsafe or are in an emergency situation will contact the nearest police station and send notifications to the Emergency number given by them and the live location of the user will be tracked by the concerned authority with the help of GPS.
  - An interface of blog is given where the users can post and see reviews regarding their locality and and according to its authenticity upvote or downvote the review and we train the Machine Learning Model using these reviews to find out whether the reviews are positive or negative for that area.
  
**2. Benefits of our app.**
  - In the era of a working woman, our app makes sure that women are given enough opportunities and independence to pursue their dreams. This app is basically built for the class of working women who often have to work late at night, or travel to unknown places. Through our app we have tried to make sure that no woman feels unsafe.
  - We provide a safety map which indicates the safety of different regions, along with the details of the nearest police station, hospital etc which can come handy in an emergency.
  - Women who are not able to report crime to the police due to various reasons , and societal pressure can now use the social blog to tell their experience about a particular place.
